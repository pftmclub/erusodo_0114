# June character Lu/Ciel (Stage 8) - Phase DU2 - Damage-state getter virtuals

## Read first (and nothing else from the plan doc unless you need it)

```sh
python tools/docsection.py JUNE_CHARACTER_LUCIEL_PHASES.md "Rules" "Starting context" "Phase DU - The two-body engine (DU1-DU5)" "Phase NU0 - New-unit and two-body engine map (read-only)"
```
Then the planning digests in `june2017_re/char_luciel/` the task names, and the Done notes of the phases this one depends on
(their routed gaps). Verify a digest line before building on it.

## Task

Do the DU2 row of "Phase DU": the five `CX2GUUser` virtuals with base bodies returning March's constants, and the two readers (the
`PhysicProcess_Jumping` test under `SERV_IRUHADEV_JUNE_USER_JUMP_UP_LINE`, StateChange's force-down flush `320348c0 @32034931-32034994`) calling
them. Check every class's vtable consumer: no March class overrides a slot it should not. Gate: probes on and off; an existing character jumps,
falls and is knocked down as before.

No hardcoded enum literals (user, 2026-10-26; CLAUDE.md): an id that has a name in an Enum (June's
`Enum.lua`, or a C++ enum) is never written as a number, in any new or touched code: use the member, and
register it under a `SERV_IRUHADEV_` flag with June's value and name if C++ lacks it. A value with no Enum
entry stays a number with a one-line comment. The one exception is a table whose rows are the data itself
(a `.tsv` of ids), not code.

No `June` prefix (user, 2026-10-28; CLAUDE.md): June's body goes inside March's own function under the flag,
March's in `#else`. A function March lacks gets a name in the class's own pattern, never with `June` in it.
Every name (locals and constants too) says what it is in context: no Ghidra address, phase tag or `June` in an identifier.
Call a March function from June code only if June's namesake does the same; otherwise replace March's definition.
Run `python tools/junediverge.py --list` before transcribing; a newly found divergent function gets its `june_march_divergent.tsv` row and the replacement in the same commit.
