# June character Ara (Stage 7) - Phase CH3a - Skills: Sakra Devanam (118)

| | |
|---|---|
| Start | new conversation on **Sonnet 5.5, high** effort, then type `/x2-phase char-ara CH3a` |
| Plan doc | `JUNE_CHARACTER_ARA_PHASES.md` (branch `main`) |
| Depends on | CH2d review. One at a time with CH1-CH4: they all edit `X2GUAra.*` |
| Flag | `SERV_IRUHADEV_JUNE_CHAR_ARA_SKILL` (+ `..._SKILL_DEBUG`) |
| Log tag | `[JUNE_CHAR]` (`ARA SKILL`), `[JUNE_SKILL]` (`--grep NUM`) |
| Review | none of its own: the CH3d review covers it (its `_DEBUG` define stays on) |

## Read first (and nothing else from the plan doc unless you need it)

```sh
python tools/docsection.py JUNE_CHARACTER_ARA_PHASES.md --no-sub "Rules" "Starting context" "Phase CH2 - Skills: Martial Artist and the first jobs (classes 7, 28, 31, 34)" "Phase CH3 - Skills: second jobs (118, 119, 124), hyper actives, transcendence"
python tools/docsection.py JUNE2017_CHARACTER_PORT_CHECKLIST.md "1. Blocker: June damage numbers come from a table this build does not have"
python tools/docsection.py JUNE_CHARACTER_RENA_PHASES.md "CH3a - Done"
```

## Task

Scope: the skill ids class 118 has and 7 / 28 lack (a skill's line decides its phase). For each id: its case in `SetEquippedSkillFuncBySkillSlotIndex` with June's state functions
whole (Ghidra, the map's addresses), inside March's case under `SERV_IRUHADEV_JUNE_CHAR_ARA_SKILL` (March's in `#else`) or a new case; its attached rows
(7u names, 7ai BFI arguments, 7h UPDOWN cancels, §7 l.256 power-rate operator, the numerical-only tables of `plan_numerical_rows.tsv`, `SPEED_TIME` rows
l.522-526); its effect closure (a name found only now is staged byte-exact and added to `ch0_assets.tsv`); its force-power gain / cost lines on CH1q's
code. Upgrade ids reach their base through the templet's `m_iDeleteSkillIDByUpgrade` (June `32071720`): check the templet swap for every term that
reads the id. A function the map does not settle (new mechanism, unmapped callee) is "this needs Opus": stop.
- `NUM use` lines for these skills; March vs June damage per skill in `MODS.md`.
- CP949: `bytepatch.py` only. Mark the ported checklist rows `(Ara: <phase>)`.
- Hand-off: the unit and class, each skill id and its A / B slot (never slot 4 / 9 before transcendence; learn only the bank under test), each
  cast twice (cool time, MP), what June's motion and effect look like.

No hardcoded enum literals (user, 2026-10-26; CLAUDE.md): an id that has a name in an Enum (June's
`Enum.lua`, or a C++ enum) is never written as a number, in any new or touched code: use the member, and
register it under a `SERV_IRUHADEV_` flag with June's value and name if C++ lacks it. A value with no Enum
entry stays a number with a one-line comment. The one exception is a table whose rows are the data itself
(a `.tsv` of ids), not code.

No `June` prefix (user, 2026-10-28; CLAUDE.md): June's body goes inside March's own function under the flag,
March's in `#else`. A function March lacks gets a name in the class's own pattern, never with `June` in it.
Every name (locals and constants too) says what it is in context: no Ghidra address, phase tag or `June` in an identifier.
Call a March function from June code only if June's namesake does the same; otherwise replace March's definition.
Run `python tools/junediverge.py --list` before transcribing; a newly found divergent function gets its `june_march_divergent.tsv` row and the replacement in the same commit.
Phase tag (user, 2026-11-09): every edited or new code block carries a one-line `// char-ara <phase>` comment (at the start of an existing one-line comment, never a second line).


## Amended by CH0

(CH0 fills this: the filter with real column numbers, the function / state / skill counts and June addresses, checklist rows, any split.)
