# June character Elsword (Stage 7) - Phase CH2b - Skills: Sword Knight (10)

| | |
|---|---|
| Start | new conversation on **Sonnet 5.5, high** effort, then type `/x2-phase char-elsword CH2b` |
| Plan doc | `JUNE_CHARACTER_ELSWORD_PHASES.md` (branch `main`) |
| Depends on | CH2a review (and any Opus `CH2b0` helper phase CH0 wrote). One at a time: `X2GUElsword_SwordMan.*` |
| Flag | `SERV_IRUHADEV_JUNE_CHAR_ELSWORD_SKILL` (+ `..._SKILL_DEBUG`) |
| Log tag | `[JUNE_CHAR]` (`ELSWORD SKILL`), `[JUNE_SKILL]` (`--grep NUM`) |
| Review | `kickoffs/char-elsword/CH2b-review.md` (Opus 5.5 high; the phase writes it when done) |

## Read first (and nothing else from the plan doc unless you need it)

```sh
python tools/docsection.py JUNE_CHARACTER_ELSWORD_PHASES.md "Rules" "Starting context" "Phase CH2 - Skills: Sword Man and the first jobs (classes 1, 10, 11, 22)" "Phase CH3 - Skills: second jobs (100, 101, 112), hyper actives, transcendence"
python tools/docsection.py JUNE2017_CHARACTER_PORT_CHECKLIST.md "1. Blocker: June damage numbers come from a table this build does not have"
```
Then CH0's and CH1's Done notes, and the `CH2b` rows of `june2017_re/char_elsword/ch0_state_skill.tsv` / `ch0_checklist_rows.tsv`.
If a checklist heading differs, `--list` and pull it by its current name.

## Task

Scope: the ids class 10 adds. For each id: its case in `SetEquippedSkillFuncBySkillSlotIndex` with June's state functions whole (Ghidra, the map's
addresses), inside March's case under `SERV_IRUHADEV_JUNE_CHAR_ELSWORD_SKILL` (March's in `#else`) or a new case; its attached rows (7u names, 7ai BFI arguments, 7h
UPDOWN cancels, the numerical-only tables, alpha-tag sites in its functions); its effect closure (a name found only now is staged byte-exact
and added to `ch0_assets.tsv`). Upgrade ids reach their base through the templet's `m_iDeleteSkillIDByUpgrade` (June `32071720`): check the
templet swap for every term that reads the id (the Aisha CH3b review defect). A function the map does not settle (new mechanism, unmapped
callee) is "this needs Opus": stop.
- `NUM use` lines for these skills; March vs June damage per skill in `MODS.md`.
- CP949: `bytepatch.py` only. Mark the ported checklist rows `(Elsword: CH2b)`.
- Hand-off: the unit and class, each skill id and its A / B slot (never slot 4 / 9 before transcendence), what June's motion and effect look like.

No hardcoded enum literals (user, 2026-10-26; CLAUDE.md): an id that has a name in an Enum (June's
`Enum.lua`, or a C++ enum) is never written as a number, in any new or touched code: use the member, and
register it under a `SERV_IRUHADEV_` flag with June's value and name if C++ lacks it. A value with no Enum
entry stays a number with a one-line comment. The one exception is a table whose rows are the data itself
(a `.tsv` of ids), not code.

No `June` prefix (user, 2026-10-28; CLAUDE.md): June's body goes inside March's own function under the flag,
March's in `#else`. A function March lacks gets a name in the class's own pattern, never with `June` in it.
Every name (locals and constants too) says what it is in context: no Ghidra address, phase tag or `June` in an identifier.
Call a March function from June code only if June's namesake does the same; otherwise replace March's definition.
Run `python tools/junediverge.py --list` before transcribing; a newly found divergent function gets its `june_march_divergent.tsv` row and the replacement in the same commit.

## Amended by CH0

(CH0 fills this: filters with real column numbers, function counts, addresses, any split.)
